  <h2>Unit One Highlight</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      This is John Nelson's page, and one highlight from Unit one in CSE was
      making our own app. The first highlight of this class is from Unit one
      in CSE making our own app. I made a whack-a-mole-like game where you had
      to tap on a moving sprite to get points and reach the next level. I
      really enjoyed making this game because of how much freedom we had, and
      this was my first time where I felt like I knew what I was coding and
      had a goal in mind, rather than just following directions.

    <h2>Unit Two Highlight</h2>
    <p>
      The second unit we did was the SDV's. This unit was probably my least
      favorite simply because of how inconsistent the SDV's vision sensor
      was. Even the smallest change of light would completely throw off the
      vision sensor, forcing you to reset it which would take at least 5
      minutes. However, I really enjoyed the satisfaction of finally getting
      it to work, especially in the final part of the unit which was making a
      convoy of the SDV's. Although I did not enjoy developing this project,
      in my opinion, this was the coolest part of this class.
    </p>

  <h2>Unit Three Highlight</h2>
  <p>
    The third unit we did was primarily on coding in Python. We were given the
    task of creating an app that would help the school. Paul and I decided to
    create an app that could track your progress in the weight room and
    calculate the percentage of your lift. I felt that I had the best grasp on
    what we were trying to accomplish in this unit, and the final product was
    one of my favorites to complete. We also came up with the super cool name,
    World of Weights, also known as WOW.
